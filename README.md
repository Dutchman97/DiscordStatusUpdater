# DiscordStatusUpdater (C#)

A replacent to my older (and previously private) [Python version of DiscordStatusUpdater](https://my.mixtape.moe/wqpgur.zip).

## Usage:

The program works out of the box on Windows 8 or newer. **If you are on an older version of Windows and the program does not work, install .NET Framework 4.5**. The installer is included in the zip file (dotNetFx45_Full_setup.exe), or if you don't trust that for some reason, [it's also here on Microsoft's site](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=30653).

To use, extract the files in the zip file to the same folder and start DiscordStatusUpdater.exe.

## Features:

* Fancy GUI with login screen
* Automatically update your status by tracking which video you are watching (with currently only support for MPC-HC, MPC-BE, and VLC)
* Manually set a custom status

## Todo:

* Add support for tracking other (user-defined) video players
* Add support for (user-defined) file extensions other than mkv, mp4, and avi files.
* Add support for user-defined rules for parsing video titles. Maybe. If it isn't too difficult.
* Err, well... What other features does this really need?
