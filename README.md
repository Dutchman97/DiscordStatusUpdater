# DiscordStatusUpdater (C#)

A replacent to my older (and previously private) [Python version of DiscordStatusUpdater](https://my.mixtape.moe/wqpgur.zip).

#Features:

* Fancy GUI with login screen
* Automatically update your status by tracking which video you are watching (with currently only support for MPC-HC, MPC-BE, and VLC)
* Manually set a custom status

#Todo:

* Add support for tracking other (user-defined) video players
* Add support for (user-defined) file extensions other than mkv, mp4, and avi files.
* Add support for user-defined rules for parsing video titles. Maybe. If it isn't too difficult.
* Err, well... What other features does this really need?
