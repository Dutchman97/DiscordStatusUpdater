# DiscordStatusUpdater (C#)

Aims to replace my (previously private) [Python version of DiscordStatusUpdater](https://my.mixtape.moe/wqpgur.zip), and new features will include:

* a GUI;
* being able to change your status message in the program itself instead of having to do it through Discord;
* ~~"auto"-detecting if you're in a game (by checking if the Discord app has changed your status to something else);~~ impossible
* support for custom video players (currently only MPC-HC, MPC-BE, and VLC are supported (and possibly unintentionally some other programs).
